Multidrop Bode Plots / AC Analysis
Contains the small ac signal analysis for the tranmission line
with varying Cdrp, the capacitance between the TL and drop-offs
The capacitances currently simulated are 1pF,2pF,3pF,4pF and 5pF.
Each folder contains the frequency plot for varying values of 
inductance, resistance, and capacitance per length.
