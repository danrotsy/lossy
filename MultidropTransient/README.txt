Multidrop Transient Signals
Signals for the 1st, Middle, and last drop-off
For various capacitances between the transmission line and drop-offs
Files are CSV and each has a specified inductance, resistance and capacitance per length for the transmission line
Also each CSV file specifices the signal it has data for
Vout: the voltage across the terminating resistor
Vn001: the voltage across the first capacitor, representing the first drop-off
Vn014: the voltage across the middle capacitor along the transmission line
Vn026: the voltage across the last capacitor on the transmission line

The files are also all organized based the the input single
The only input single pulse simulated is a single pulse
with a width of 16ns and rise and fall times of 2ns each
